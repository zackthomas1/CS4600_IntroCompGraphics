<h3> Project 2: Transformations </h3>
<p> A 2D drone piloting simulation. Project objective to learn about transformation matrices in 2D space.</p>

<h3> Project 3: Curves </h3> 
<p> WebGL based interactive quadratic bezier spline.</p>

<h3> Hello WebGL </h3> 
<p> Intro to webGL. First complete program.</p>

<h3> Project 4: Triangles </h3> 
<p> A .obj model viewer using WebGL. View 3D models with textures. Option to display vertex normals. No lighting.</p>

<h3> Project 5: Shading </h3> 
<p> Extends project 4 model viewer web application implementing a blinn/phong shading model. Light source is a single directional light.</p>

<h3> Project 6: Ray Tracing </h3> 
<p> Real-time Turner Whitted raytracing for perfect reflections. Also extended the application to use raytracing to render quadratic surfaces, such as a parabloid and a cone. </p>
